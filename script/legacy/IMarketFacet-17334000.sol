     *       their transaction filled before the user can have cancelOffer filled. The most ideal situation for the user is to not have placed the unfavorable market offer
     *       in the first place since an attacker can always monitor our marketplace and potentially identify profitable market offers. Our UI will aide users in not placing
     *       market offers that are obviously unfavorable to the user and/or seem like mistake orders. In the event that a user needs to cancel an offer, it is recommended to
     *       use Flashbots in order to privately send your transaction so an attack cannot be triggered from monitoring the mempool for calls to cancelOffer. A user is recommended
     *       to change their RPC endpoint to point to https://rpc.flashbots.net when calling cancelOffer. We will add additional documentation to aide our users in this process.
