README for the Gemforge build process.

Note the folowing files and folders:

- `gemforge.config.cjs` - gemforge [configuration](https://gemforge.xyz/configuration/)
- `gemforge.deployments.json` - deployed contracts and their tx, addresses for every gemforge target
- `.gemforge/` - temporary staging area used by gemforge
- `src/generated` - all code generated by gemforge
- `script/gemforge` - relevant CLI scripts

## Building

To compile contracts:

```
yarn build
```

##Â Devnet

To run the local devnet:

```
yarn anvil
```

## Deployments

A script - `script/gemforge/deploy.js` - is provided as a convenience for handling the Nayms phased deployments flow. You can call this directly or just use `yarn deploy ...`

**Fresh deployments**

To do a fresh deployment to [target `<target>`](https://gemforge.xyz/configuration/targets/):

```
yarn deploy <target> --fresh
```

**Upgrades**

To upgrade a deployment on `<target>`:

```
yarn deploy <target>
```

**NOTE: This assumes that the second address on the deployment wallet is the system admin address. Mainnet deployments via Qredo MPC are not yet supported in this script.**
